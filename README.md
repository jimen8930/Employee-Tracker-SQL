## Installation
Clone the repo

Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

Using the terminal, install node.js v16. If you have homebrew, the command should look like the following (brew install node@16), however this may vary and the documentation should be consulted.

Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored. Also, you'll need to use the MySQL2 package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, and the Inquirer package to interact with the user via the command line.

Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application 
To run the server, within the terminal, type the command npm start or node server.js.

Once the server is running, users can then access the back end of the application within the browser to observe full functionality of the site.

## Usage
This application is powered by mySQL workbench and MAMP meaning for it to function properly, there needs to be a server running in the background. To start the server, navigate to the directory of the application, install all dependencies (npm i), then type the command npm start (or node server.js). The inquirer will prompt a series of questions. The user will choose and input information needed to tarck employees.
